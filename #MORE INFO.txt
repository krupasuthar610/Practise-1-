1. Private:  The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. 
             It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
2. Default:  within the package.
             If you do not specify any access level,it will be the default.

3. Protected:  within the package and outside 
               the package through the child class. If you do not make the child class,

Object 
---------
	o An object is a real-world entity.
	o An object is a runtime entity.
	o The object is an entity that has a state and behavior.
	o The object is an instance of a class.
	 
 
For Example, Pen is an object. Its name is Reynolds; the color is white, known as its state.
It is used to write, so writing is its behavior.
An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which 
objects are created. So, an object is an instance(result) of a class.

An array is a collection of similar types of data. For example,
 if we want to store the names of 100 people then we can create 
 an array of the string type that can store 100 names. 
      String[] array = new String[100]; Here, the above array cannot store more than 100 names.
