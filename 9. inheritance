inheritance
------------
	• Father and child relationship called inheritance.
	• Reduce the length of the code.
	• Reduce the code duplication
	• IS-A  relation


• The  Process of acquiring properties and behavior, the one class to another class is called 
  inheritance.
• Acquiring inheritance by extended keywords.
         
• Extends :-
It makes the relationship between the two classes, once the action is done automatically 
code is reused.

• Type of inheritance	

(1)Single 
father and child relation.
	      
(2)Multilevel 
Ek class Je father and child banne relation perform kare che.

(3)Hierarchical
one father having more than one child.

(4)Multiple
two parent one child.
class c extends  a,b
// inheritance not support multiple inheritance concept.
 to avoid complexity and ambiguity that arise when two classes have methods with the same name. 
This ensures clarity and simplicity in Java’s design.

(5)Hybrid

inheritance also not support hybrid.


NOTE:
•Every class in the java programming is a child class of object.
•The root class for all java classes is Object class.
•The default package in the java programming is java.lang package


Final:-
•Final is the modifier applicable for classes, methods and variables (for all instance, Static and local variables).
•if a class is declared as final, then we cannot inherit that class i.e., we cannot create any child class for that final class.
•Every method present inside a final class is always final by default but every variable present inside the final class need not be final.
•The main advantage of final modifier is we can achieve security as no one can be allowed to change our implementation.
•But the main disadvantage of final keyword is we are missing key benefits of Oops like inheritance and polymorphism. Hence is there is no specific requirement never recommended 
 to use final modifier
