Hiding the internal implementation and highlighting the set of services that process is 
called abstraction.

Example :
ATM machine je aapne bau bodhi functionality provides kare che pan internally process show
nathi kartu.

here are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
	1. Abstract class (0 to 100%)
	2. Interface (100%)
 
classes are devided into two types
1) Normal classes
2) Abstract classes
Normal classes:-
Normal class is a java class it contains only normal methods.
Abstract class:-
A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.

Points to Remember
	• An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
	• Abstract class is a java class which contains at least one abstract method.
	• It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
	• It cannot be instantiated.
	• It can have constructors and static methods also.
	• It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the
   	  method.
	• To specify the particular class is abstract and particular method is abstract method to the 
          compiler use abstract modifier.
        • For the abstract classes it is not possible to create an object. Because it contains the 
          unimplemented methods.
        • For any class if we don’t want instantiation then we have to declare that class as abstract i.e., for 
          abstract classes instantiation (creation of object) is not possible


 void add(){}
abstract void add();

•The method which is having declaration but not implementations such type of methods 
 are called abstract Method. Hence every abstract method should end with “;”.
•The child classes are responsible to provide implementation for parent class abstract
 methods.
• if method decalre as abstarct its must have in abstract class otehtr wise sysytem gernate compile time error.
