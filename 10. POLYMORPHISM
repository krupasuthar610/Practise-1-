polymorephism:
   
one functionality with different bahaviors is called polymorphism.
the ability to appear in many forms is called polymorphism.

	
• Two type :-
    1. Compile time  - overloading 
    2. Run time - overriding
             

Overloading
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters,
it is known as Method Overloading.
 
There are two ways to overload the method in java
	1. By changing number of arguments
	2. By changing the argument and argument  data type
	
In Java, Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only.
	
	
Can we overload java main() method?
Yes, by method overloading. You can have any number of main methods in a class by method 
overloading. But JVM calls main() method which receives string array as arguments only. 
Let's see the simple example:
3. class TestOverloading4{  
4. public static void main(String[] args){System.out.println("main with String[]");}  
5. public static void main(String args){System.out.println("main with String");}  
6. public static void main(){System.out.println("main without args");}  
7. }  
Test it Now
Output:
main with String[]

Method Overriding in Java
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class,
it is known as method overriding in Java.

A child class extends parent class , and If child class have same method as parent class ,
only change method body implementation known as overriding concept 

To achiving overriding concept we required two java classes with inheritance relationship.


Rules for Java Method Overriding
	1. The method must have the same name as in the parent class
	2. The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
	3. There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).


Why can we not override static method?
It is because the static method is bound with class whereas instance method is bound with 
an object.Static belongs to the class area, and an instance belongs to the heap area.

Can we override java main method?
No, because the main is a static method.

EX:
sleep(1000)
sleep(1000,2000)

wait()
wait(1000)
wait(1000,2000)

there are two type of polymorphism in java

1) compile time polymorphism /static binding / early bionding
      ex : method overloading

2) Runtime polymorphism / dynamic binding / late binding.
      ex : method overriding


three type of overloading
a. method overloading
b. Constructor overloading
c. Operator overloading

Constructor Overloading:-
The constructors are having same name but different argument list such type of constructors 
are called Overloaded constructors.

Operator overloading:-
One operator can act as more than one form is called Operator overloading .
the only operator overloaded in java language is ‘+’.
Ex:- class Test 
{
public static void main(String[] args) 
{
String str1="Rattaiah";
String str2="Durga";
System.out.println(str1);
System.out.println(str1);
System.out.println(str1+str2);
int a=10;
int b=20;
System.out.println(a);
System.out.println(b);
System.out.println(a+b);
}
}
