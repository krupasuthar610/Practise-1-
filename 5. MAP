Map
Stores entries as key-value pairs.
Each key is unique.
Values can be duplicated.
Common implementations: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap.

Feature	            HashMap	                     LinkedHashMap	                                      TreeMap
Order	            No order	                 Maintains insertion order	                Sorted by keys (natural or custom order)
Null Keys	        1 allowed	                 1 allowed	                                Not allowed (for keys)
Speed	            Fast (O(1) for get/put)	     Slightly slower than HashMap	            Slower (O(log n) for get/put)
Internal Use	    Hash table	                 Hash table + Linked list	                Red-Black Tree
Use Case	        Best for quick access	     When you need order + access speed	        When you need sorted keys


HashMap → Fast lookup, no order needed.

LinkedHashMap → Want order preserved.

TreeMap → Want keys sorted.
