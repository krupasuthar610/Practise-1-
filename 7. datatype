
 
1. used to represent the type of the variable & expressions.
2. Represent how much memory is allocated for the variable.
3. Specifies the range value of the variable.
 
 
 
* There are 8 primitive data types in java
 
DataType      size(in bytes)          Range                                         default values
 
byte                     1                 -128 to                                                                  0
short                   2         -32768 to 32767                                                          0
int                      4           -2147483648      to       2147483647                        
long                   8           –9,223,372,036,854,775,808 
                                                to                                                     0
                                      9,223,372,036,854,775,807 
float                  4                    -3.4e38 to 3.4e                           0.0
double            8                 -1.7e308 to 1.7e308                        0.0
char                2                              0 to 6553                    single spaced
Boolean       no-size                      no-range                              false
 
 
 
BYTE:-
Size: 1-byte
MAX_VALUE : 127
MIN_VALUE : -128
Rang: -128 to 127
 
* to represent numeric value(10, 20, 30...etc) 
       byte   short    int       long
 
* To represent decimal values(floating point values 10.5,30.6…etc) 
      float  double
 
*To represent character use char and take the character 
    within single quotes.
    
*To represent true, and false use Boolean.
 
*Except Boolean and char remaining all data types consider signed data types because we can 
represent both +ve & -ve values.
 
*Float vs double:-
   The float will give 5 to 6 decimal places of accuracy but double gives 14 to 15 places of accuracy.
